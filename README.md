### This is a personal project that roughly implemented the structure of the main functions used in previous work for remembering.

## Introduction
This is a windows-based system that collects, stores, and manages data(log) generated by a particular application(any program can be possible).


## System Overview

The system is divided into four parts: server, client, application that generate data and web page for admin. Among them, the server and client were implemented, and the functions for policy setting of the administrator page and log generation testing were added.
