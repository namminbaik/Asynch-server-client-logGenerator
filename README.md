### This is a personal project that roughly implemented the structure of the main functions used in previous work for remembering.

## Introduction
This is a windows-based system that collects, stores, and manages data(log) generated by a particular application(any program can be possible).


## System Overview

The system is divided into four parts: server, client, application that generate data and web page for admin. Among them, the server and client were implemented, and the functions for policy setting of the administrator page and log generation testing were added.

## Module Descriptions

### Server (C#/Asynchronous Socket)

This is a collecting server that receive and process information collected from multiple clients via asynchronous socket, and send modified policy information to all connected clients.

### 클라이언트 (C/C++)

특정 어플리케이션에서 생성된 로그 데이터를 모니터링하여 서버로 전송하고, 서버에서 전송된 정책 정보를 특정 어플리케이션으로 IPC를 통해 전달한다.
