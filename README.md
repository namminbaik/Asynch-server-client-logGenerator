### This is a personal project that roughly implemented the structure of the main functions used in previous work for remembering. (IDE: Visual Studio 2017)

# Introduction
This is a windows-based system that collects, stores, and manages data(log) generated by a particular application(any program can be possible).


# System Overview

The system is divided into four parts: server, client, application that generate data and web page for admin. Among them, the server and client were implemented, and the functions for policy setting of the administrator page and log generation testing were added.

# Module Descriptions

### Server (C#/Asynchronous Socket)

It is a collecting server that receive and process information collected from multiple clients via asynchronous socket, and send modified policy information to all connected clients.

### Client (C/C++)

It is a client that monitor and transmit log data generated by a specific application to the server, and communicate policy information sent from the server through IPC to the specific application.
